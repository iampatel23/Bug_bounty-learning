### **What is Bug Bounty?**
Bug bounty programs allow independent security researchers to report bugs to an organization and receive rewards or compensation. These bugs are usually security exploits and vulnerabilities, though they can also include process issues, hardware flaws, and so on.
The reports are typically made through a program run by an independent third party like: ## [Hackerone] (https://www.hackerone.com/) and [BugCrowd] (https://www.bugcrowd.com/).
